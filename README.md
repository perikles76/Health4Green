# Health4Green
This project aims to establish a link between health and green spaces in the urban environemnt. Mainly interested in the physical health for the general population, this could also focus on specifi population groups like the elderly and the adolescent. Test cities could include some with limited green spaces and some with extended green spaces to decide a baseline. Open access data will be used. This pet project is mainly a test to explore the posibilties of GitHub and to play with various statistical tools.
